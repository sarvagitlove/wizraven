## Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Configuration
Create a Firebase project and download the service account credentials. Update `.env`:

```env
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your-private-key-id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nyour-private-key-here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account-email@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id

```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed --class=RoleSeeder
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
php artisan serve --port=8001
```

### 4. Create First Admin User
Use the API to create an admin user or manually insert into database:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, role_id, status, created_at, updated_at) 
VALUES ('Admin User', 'admin@atea-seattle.org', 1, 'active', NOW(), NOW());
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
